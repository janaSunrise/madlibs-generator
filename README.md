# Madlibs Generator using Python

This is a casual fun project built with python, that forms a new Madlib puzzle for you everytime, you run it.

### Tech Stack used

I have used following libraries:

- `Requests`: For Handling the API Request, and Getting JSON Response for forming the Madlibs Puzzle.
- `Colorama`: For colorized interactive input, which looks more appealing to the end users.

### TODOs Planned:

- [ ] Make a GUI Version of this program
- [ ] Try implementing Markov Chain for generation using machine

## How to run the project?

- Install pipenv using `pip install pipenv`
- Sync the dependencies: `pipenv sync`
- Run the project: `pipenv run start`
